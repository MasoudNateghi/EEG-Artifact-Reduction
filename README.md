# EEG-Artifact-Reduction-
In this repository, I have some pieces of codes in which I have implemented some blind\semi-blind source separation methods like PCA, GEVD, ICA, and DSS to eliminate EEG artifacts. 

## Ex1

## Ex2
- Contains a non-epileptic simulated data which we contaminated it with background EEG signal and muscle noise
- Extracted sources using PCA and Com2 (on of ICA algorithms) and eliminated undesirable sources
- Transfered the data to sensor space. Moreover, calculated RRMSE for the two methods.
